# Skill authoring best practices

> Learn how to write effective Skills that Claude can discover and use successfully.

Good Skills are concise, well-structured, and tested with real usage. This guide provides practical authoring decisions to help you write Skills that Claude can discover and use effectively.

For conceptual background on how Skills work, see the [Skills overview](/en/docs/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview).

## Core principles

### Concise is key

The [context window](/en/docs/build-with-claude/context-windows) is a public good. Your Skill shares the context window with everything else Claude needs to know, including:

* The system prompt
* Conversation history
* Other Skills' metadata
* Your actual request

Not every token in your Skill has an immediate cost. At startup, only the metadata (name and description) from all Skills is pre-loaded. Claude reads SKILL.md only when the Skill becomes relevant, and reads additional files only as needed. However, being concise in SKILL.md still matters: once Claude loads it, every token competes with conversation history and other context.

**Default assumption**: Claude is already very smart

Only add context Claude doesn't already have. Challenge each piece of information:

* "Does Claude really need this explanation?"
* "Can I assume Claude knows this?"
* "Does this paragraph justify its token cost?"

**Good (50 tokens)**: Direct code example with library usage
**Bad (150 tokens)**: Explains what PDFs are, why libraries exist, installation basics

Assume Claude knows common concepts. Only add context Claude doesn't already have.

### Set appropriate degrees of freedom

Match specificity to task fragility:

* **High freedom** (text instructions): Multiple valid approaches, context-dependent decisions
* **Medium freedom** (pseudocode/parameterized scripts): Preferred pattern exists, some variation acceptable
* **Low freedom** (specific scripts): Fragile operations, consistency critical, exact sequence required

**Analogy**: Narrow bridge = exact instructions (low freedom). Open field = general direction (high freedom).

### Test with all models you plan to use

Skills act as additions to models, so effectiveness depends on the underlying model. Test your Skill with all the models you plan to use it with.

**Testing considerations by model**:

* **Claude Haiku** (fast, economical): Does the Skill provide enough guidance?
* **Claude Sonnet** (balanced): Is the Skill clear and efficient?
* **Claude Opus** (powerful reasoning): Does the Skill avoid over-explaining?

What works perfectly for Opus might need more detail for Haiku. If you plan to use your Skill across multiple models, aim for instructions that work well with all of them.

## Skill structure

<Note>
  **YAML Frontmatter**: The SKILL.md frontmatter requires two fields:

  `name`:

  * Maximum 64 characters
  * Must contain only lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens
  * Cannot contain XML tags
  * Cannot contain reserved words: "anthropic", "claude"

  `description`:

  * Must be non-empty
  * Maximum 1024 characters
  * Cannot contain XML tags
  * Should describe what the Skill does and when to use it

  For complete Skill structure details, see the [Skills overview](/en/docs/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview#skill-structure).
</Note>

### Naming conventions

Use consistent naming patterns to make Skills easier to reference and discuss. We recommend using **gerund form** (verb + -ing) for Skill names, as this clearly describes the activity or capability the Skill provides.

Remember that the `name` field must use lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only.

**Good naming examples (gerund form)**:

* `processing-pdfs`
* `analyzing-spreadsheets`
* `managing-databases`
* `testing-code`
* `writing-documentation`

**Acceptable alternatives**:

* Noun phrases: `pdf-processing`, `spreadsheet-analysis`
* Action-oriented: `process-pdfs`, `analyze-spreadsheets`

**Avoid**:

* Vague names: `helper`, `utils`, `tools`
* Overly generic: `documents`, `data`, `files`
* Reserved words: `anthropic-helper`, `claude-tools`
* Inconsistent patterns within your skill collection

Consistent naming makes it easier to:

* Reference Skills in documentation and conversations
* Understand what a Skill does at a glance
* Organize and search through multiple Skills
* Maintain a professional, cohesive skill library

### Writing effective descriptions

The `description` field enables Skill discovery and should include both what the Skill does and when to use it.

<Warning>
  **Always write in third person**. The description is injected into the system prompt, and inconsistent point-of-view can cause discovery problems.

  * **Good:** "Processes Excel files and generates reports"
  * **Avoid:** "I can help you process Excel files"
  * **Avoid:** "You can use this to process Excel files"
</Warning>

**Be specific and include key terms**. Include both what the Skill does and specific triggers/contexts for when to use it.

Each Skill has exactly one description field. The description is critical for skill selection: Claude uses it to choose the right Skill from potentially 100+ available Skills. Your description must provide enough detail for Claude to know when to select this Skill, while the rest of SKILL.md provides the implementation details.

Effective examples:

**PDF Processing skill:**

```yaml  theme={null}
description: Extract text and tables from PDF files, fill forms, merge documents. Use when working with PDF files or when the user mentions PDFs, forms, or document extraction.
```

**Excel Analysis skill:**

```yaml  theme={null}
description: Analyze Excel spreadsheets, create pivot tables, generate charts. Use when analyzing Excel files, spreadsheets, tabular data, or .xlsx files.
```

**Git Commit Helper skill:**

```yaml  theme={null}
description: Generate descriptive commit messages by analyzing git diffs. Use when the user asks for help writing commit messages or reviewing staged changes.
```

Avoid vague descriptions like these:

```yaml  theme={null}
description: Helps with documents
```

```yaml  theme={null}
description: Processes data
```

```yaml  theme={null}
description: Does stuff with files
```

### Progressive disclosure patterns

SKILL.md serves as an overview that points Claude to detailed materials as needed, like a table of contents in an onboarding guide. For an explanation of how progressive disclosure works, see [How Skills work](/en/docs/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview#how-skills-work) in the overview.

**Practical guidance:**

* Keep SKILL.md body under 500 lines for optimal performance
* Split content into separate files when approaching this limit
* Use the patterns below to organize instructions, code, and resources effectively

#### Visual overview: From simple to complex

A basic Skill starts with just a SKILL.md file containing metadata and instructions:

<img src="https://mintcdn.com/anthropic-claude-docs/4Bny2bjzuGBK7o00/images/agent-skills-simple-file.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=4Bny2bjzuGBK7o00&q=85&s=87782ff239b297d9a9e8e1b72ed72db9" alt="Simple SKILL.md file showing YAML frontmatter and markdown body" data-og-width="2048" width="2048" data-og-height="1153" height="1153" data-path="images/agent-skills-simple-file.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3" srcset="https://mintcdn.com/anthropic-claude-docs/4Bny2bjzuGBK7o00/images/agent-skills-simple-file.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=4Bny2bjzuGBK7o00&q=85&s=c61cc33b6f5855809907f7fda94cd80e 280w, https://mintcdn.com/anthropic-claude-docs/4Bny2bjzuGBK7o00/images/agent-skills-simple-file.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=4Bny2bjzuGBK7o00&q=85&s=90d2c0c1c76b36e8d485f49e0810dbfd 560w, https://mintcdn.com/anthropic-claude-docs/4Bny2bjzuGBK7o00/images/agent-skills-simple-file.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=4Bny2bjzuGBK7o00&q=85&s=ad17d231ac7b0bea7e5b4d58fb4aeabb 840w, https://mintcdn.com/anthropic-claude-docs/4Bny2bjzuGBK7o00/images/agent-skills-simple-file.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=4Bny2bjzuGBK7o00&q=85&s=f5d0a7a3c668435bb0aee9a3a8f8c329 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/anthropic-claude-docs/4Bny2bjzuGBK7o00/images/agent-skills-simple-file.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=4Bny2bjzuGBK7o00&q=85&s=0e927c1af9de5799cfe557d12249f6e6 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/anthropic-claude-docs/4Bny2bjzuGBK7o00/images/agent-skills-simple-file.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=4Bny2bjzuGBK7o00&q=85&s=46bbb1a51dd4c8202a470ac8c80a893d 2500w" />

As your Skill grows, you can bundle additional content that Claude loads only when needed:

<img src="https://mintcdn.com/anthropic-claude-docs/4Bny2bjzuGBK7o00/images/agent-skills-bundling-content.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=4Bny2bjzuGBK7o00&q=85&s=a5e0aa41e3d53985a7e3e43668a33ea3" alt="Bundling additional reference files like reference.md and forms.md." data-og-width="2048" width="2048" data-og-height="1327" height="1327" data-path="images/agent-skills-bundling-content.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3" srcset="https://mintcdn.com/anthropic-claude-docs/4Bny2bjzuGBK7o00/images/agent-skills-bundling-content.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=4Bny2bjzuGBK7o00&q=85&s=f8a0e73783e99b4a643d79eac86b70a2 280w, https://mintcdn.com/anthropic-claude-docs/4Bny2bjzuGBK7o00/images/agent-skills-bundling-content.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=4Bny2bjzuGBK7o00&q=85&s=dc510a2a9d3f14359416b706f067904a 560w, https://mintcdn.com/anthropic-claude-docs/4Bny2bjzuGBK7o00/images/agent-skills-bundling-content.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=4Bny2bjzuGBK7o00&q=85&s=82cd6286c966303f7dd914c28170e385 840w, https://mintcdn.com/anthropic-claude-docs/4Bny2bjzuGBK7o00/images/agent-skills-bundling-content.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=4Bny2bjzuGBK7o00&q=85&s=56f3be36c77e4fe4b523df209a6824c6 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/anthropic-claude-docs/4Bny2bjzuGBK7o00/images/agent-skills-bundling-content.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=4Bny2bjzuGBK7o00&q=85&s=d22b5161b2075656417d56f41a74f3dd 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/anthropic-claude-docs/4Bny2bjzuGBK7o00/images/agent-skills-bundling-content.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=4Bny2bjzuGBK7o00&q=85&s=3dd4bdd6850ffcc96c6c45fcb0acd6eb 2500w" />

The complete Skill directory structure might look like this:

```
pdf/
├── SKILL.md              # Main instructions (loaded when triggered)
├── FORMS.md              # Form-filling guide (loaded as needed)
├── reference.md          # API reference (loaded as needed)
├── examples.md           # Usage examples (loaded as needed)
└── scripts/
    ├── analyze_form.py   # Utility script (executed, not loaded)
    ├── fill_form.py      # Form filling script
    └── validate.py       # Validation script
```

#### Pattern 1: High-level guide with references

Put essential quick-start content in SKILL.md, link to detailed guides:
* **Quick start**: Basic code/instructions in SKILL.md
* **Advanced features**: Link to separate files (FORMS.md, REFERENCE.md, EXAMPLES.md)

Claude loads referenced files only when needed.

#### Pattern 2: Domain-specific organization

Organize by domain to avoid loading irrelevant context. Structure: `reference/finance.md`, `reference/sales.md`, etc.

Claude loads only the domain-specific file needed (e.g., sales.md for pipeline queries).

#### Pattern 3: Conditional details

Show basic instructions in SKILL.md, link to specialized guides for advanced features.

Claude reads specialized files only when user needs those specific features.

### Avoid deeply nested references

Claude may partially read files when they're referenced from other referenced files. When encountering nested references, Claude might use commands like `head -100` to preview content rather than reading entire files, resulting in incomplete information.

**Keep references one level deep from SKILL.md**. All reference files should link directly from SKILL.md to ensure Claude reads complete files when needed.

**Bad example: Too deep**:

```markdown  theme={null}
# SKILL.md
See [advanced.md](advanced.md)...

# advanced.md
See [details.md](details.md)...

# details.md
Here's the actual information...
```

**Good example: One level deep**:

```markdown  theme={null}
# SKILL.md

**Basic usage**: [instructions in SKILL.md]
**Advanced features**: See [advanced.md](advanced.md)
**API reference**: See [reference.md](reference.md)
**Examples**: See [examples.md](examples.md)
```

### Structure longer reference files with table of contents

For reference files longer than 100 lines, include a table of contents at the top. This ensures Claude can see the full scope of available information even when previewing with partial reads.

**Example**:

```markdown  theme={null}
# API Reference

## Contents
- Authentication and setup
- Core methods (create, read, update, delete)
- Advanced features (batch operations, webhooks)
- Error handling patterns
- Code examples

## Authentication and setup
...

## Core methods
...
```

Claude can then read the complete file or jump to specific sections as needed.

For details on how this filesystem-based architecture enables progressive disclosure, see the [Runtime environment](#runtime-environment) section in the Advanced section below.

## Performance optimization

Efficient Skills balance comprehensive functionality with minimal resource usage. Consider these optimization strategies:

### Minimize frontmatter overhead

The `name` and `description` fields are pre-loaded for all Skills at startup. Keep them concise:

* **name**: Maximum 64 characters (enforced)
* **description**: Maximum 1024 characters (enforced), but aim for 300-500 characters when possible

Shorter descriptions improve discovery speed when Claude evaluates many Skills.

### Use lazy loading patterns

Progressive disclosure isn't just about organization—it's a performance feature:

* **SKILL.md body**: Loaded only when the Skill triggers (target: under 500 lines)
* **Reference files**: Loaded only when Claude needs specific information
* **Scripts**: Executed without loading into context; only output consumes tokens

**Example of effective lazy loading:**

```markdown  theme={null}
# SKILL.md - Core instructions only

For basic extraction, use pdfplumber (see [BASIC_USAGE.md](BASIC_USAGE.md))
For forms with complex layouts, see [FORM_PROCESSING.md](FORM_PROCESSING.md)
For OCR requirements, see [OCR_GUIDE.md](OCR_GUIDE.md)
```

Claude loads only the specific guide needed for the current task.

### Design for composition over duplication

Instead of creating large, multi-purpose Skills, create focused Skills that work together:

* **Good**: Separate Skills for "data-validation", "report-formatting", "chart-generation"
* **Avoid**: One massive "data-analysis-suite" Skill that duplicates common patterns

Claude automatically combines relevant Skills when needed, and focused Skills activate more reliably.

### Consider token efficiency in instructions

When writing SKILL.md content:

* **Prioritize**: Information Claude doesn't already know
* **Remove**: General explanations of common concepts
* **Compress**: Use code examples instead of lengthy prose when possible

**Example - Before optimization** (150 tokens):

```markdown  theme={null}
PDF files are Portable Document Format files commonly used for documents.
To work with PDFs in Python, you'll need to install a library. There are
several options available, each with different capabilities. The installation
process typically uses pip...
```

**Example - After optimization** (50 tokens):

```markdown  theme={null}
Install pdfplumber for text extraction:
```python
pip install pdfplumber
```

For scanned PDFs, use pdf2image with pytesseract instead.
```

The optimized version provides the same essential information in one-third the tokens.

## Workflows and feedback loops

### Use workflows for complex tasks

Break complex operations into clear, sequential steps. Provide a checklist that Claude can copy and check off as it progresses.

**Pattern**:
1. Provide copyable checklist with step names
2. Detail each step with specific actions
3. Include validation/verification steps
4. Specify when to loop back if errors occur

The checklist pattern works for analysis tasks (without code) and scripted tasks (with code). Clear steps prevent skipping critical validation.

### Implement feedback loops

**Pattern**: action → validate → fix errors → repeat

Greatly improves output quality. Validator can be a script or reference document (e.g., STYLE_GUIDE.md).

**Key principle**: Validate immediately after each action, only proceed when validation passes.

## Content guidelines

### Avoid time-sensitive information

Don't include information that will become outdated:

**Bad example: Time-sensitive** (will become wrong):

```markdown  theme={null}
If you're doing this before August 2025, use the old API.
After August 2025, use the new API.
```

**Good example** (use "old patterns" section):

```markdown  theme={null}
## Current method

Use the v2 API endpoint: `api.example.com/v2/messages`

## Old patterns

<details>
<summary>Legacy v1 API (deprecated 2025-08)</summary>

The v1 API used: `api.example.com/v1/messages`

This endpoint is no longer supported.
</details>
```

The old patterns section provides historical context without cluttering the main content.

### Use consistent terminology

Choose one term and use it throughout the Skill:

**Good - Consistent**:

* Always "API endpoint"
* Always "field"
* Always "extract"

**Bad - Inconsistent**:

* Mix "API endpoint", "URL", "API route", "path"
* Mix "field", "box", "element", "control"
* Mix "extract", "pull", "get", "retrieve"

Consistency helps Claude understand and follow instructions.

## Common patterns

### Template pattern

Provide output templates matching your requirements:

* **Strict**: "ALWAYS use this exact structure" (for API responses, data formats)
* **Flexible**: "Use this default format, but adapt as needed" (when context varies)

Match strictness level to task requirements.

### Examples pattern

Provide input/output pairs when output quality depends on seeing examples.

Include 2-3 examples showing desired style and level of detail. Examples are more effective than descriptions alone for style-sensitive tasks.

### Conditional workflow pattern

Guide Claude through decision points with branching workflows:

1. Present decision criteria
2. Branch to appropriate workflow based on condition
3. Provide clear steps for each branch

Useful when task approach depends on input type or requirements.

<Tip>
  If workflows become large or complicated with many steps, consider pushing them into separate files and tell Claude to read the appropriate file based on the task at hand.
</Tip>

## Evaluation and iteration

### Build evaluations first

**Create evaluations BEFORE writing extensive documentation.** This ensures your Skill solves real problems rather than documenting imagined ones.

**Evaluation-driven development:**

1. **Identify gaps**: Run Claude on representative tasks without a Skill. Document specific failures or missing context
2. **Create evaluations**: Build three scenarios that test these gaps
3. **Establish baseline**: Measure Claude's performance without the Skill
4. **Write minimal instructions**: Create just enough content to address the gaps and pass evaluations
5. **Iterate**: Execute evaluations, compare against baseline, and refine

This approach ensures you're solving actual problems rather than anticipating requirements that may never materialize.

**Evaluation structure**:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "skills": ["pdf-processing"],
  "query": "Extract all text from this PDF file and save it to output.txt",
  "files": ["test-files/document.pdf"],
  "expected_behavior": [
    "Successfully reads the PDF file using an appropriate PDF processing library or command-line tool",
    "Extracts text content from all pages in the document without missing any pages",
    "Saves the extracted text to a file named output.txt in a clear, readable format"
  ]
}
```

<Note>
  This example demonstrates a data-driven evaluation with a simple testing rubric. We do not currently provide a built-in way to run these evaluations. Users can create their own evaluation system. Evaluations are your source of truth for measuring Skill effectiveness.
</Note>

### Develop Skills iteratively with Claude

The most effective Skill development process involves Claude itself. Work with one instance of Claude ("Claude A") to create a Skill that will be used by other instances ("Claude B"). Claude A helps you design and refine instructions, while Claude B tests them in real tasks. This works because Claude models understand both how to write effective agent instructions and what information agents need.

**Creating a new Skill:**

1. **Complete a task without a Skill**: Work through a problem with Claude A using normal prompting. As you work, you'll naturally provide context, explain preferences, and share procedural knowledge. Notice what information you repeatedly provide.

2. **Identify the reusable pattern**: After completing the task, identify what context you provided that would be useful for similar future tasks.

   **Example**: If you worked through a BigQuery analysis, you might have provided table names, field definitions, filtering rules (like "always exclude test accounts"), and common query patterns.

3. **Ask Claude A to create a Skill**: "Create a Skill that captures this BigQuery analysis pattern we just used. Include the table schemas, naming conventions, and the rule about filtering test accounts."

   <Tip>
     Claude models understand the Skill format and structure natively. You don't need special system prompts or a "writing skills" skill to get Claude to help create Skills. Simply ask Claude to create a Skill and it will generate properly structured SKILL.md content with appropriate frontmatter and body content.
   </Tip>

4. **Review for conciseness**: Check that Claude A hasn't added unnecessary explanations. Ask: "Remove the explanation about what win rate means - Claude already knows that."

5. **Improve information architecture**: Ask Claude A to organize the content more effectively. For example: "Organize this so the table schema is in a separate reference file. We might add more tables later."

6. **Test on similar tasks**: Use the Skill with Claude B (a fresh instance with the Skill loaded) on related use cases. Observe whether Claude B finds the right information, applies rules correctly, and handles the task successfully.

7. **Iterate based on observation**: If Claude B struggles or misses something, return to Claude A with specifics: "When Claude used this Skill, it forgot to filter by date for Q4. Should we add a section about date filtering patterns?"

**Iterating on existing Skills:**

The same hierarchical pattern continues when improving Skills. You alternate between:

* **Working with Claude A** (the expert who helps refine the Skill)
* **Testing with Claude B** (the agent using the Skill to perform real work)
* **Observing Claude B's behavior** and bringing insights back to Claude A

1. **Use the Skill in real workflows**: Give Claude B (with the Skill loaded) actual tasks, not test scenarios

2. **Observe Claude B's behavior**: Note where it struggles, succeeds, or makes unexpected choices

   **Example observation**: "When I asked Claude B for a regional sales report, it wrote the query but forgot to filter out test accounts, even though the Skill mentions this rule."

3. **Return to Claude A for improvements**: Share the current SKILL.md and describe what you observed. Ask: "I noticed Claude B forgot to filter test accounts when I asked for a regional report. The Skill mentions filtering, but maybe it's not prominent enough?"

4. **Review Claude A's suggestions**: Claude A might suggest reorganizing to make rules more prominent, using stronger language like "MUST filter" instead of "always filter", or restructuring the workflow section.

5. **Apply and test changes**: Update the Skill with Claude A's refinements, then test again with Claude B on similar requests

6. **Repeat based on usage**: Continue this observe-refine-test cycle as you encounter new scenarios. Each iteration improves the Skill based on real agent behavior, not assumptions.

**Gathering team feedback:**

1. Share Skills with teammates and observe their usage
2. Ask: Does the Skill activate when expected? Are instructions clear? What's missing?
3. Incorporate feedback to address blind spots in your own usage patterns

**Why this approach works**: Claude A understands agent needs, you provide domain expertise, Claude B reveals gaps through real usage, and iterative refinement improves Skills based on observed behavior rather than assumptions.

### Observe how Claude navigates Skills

As you iterate on Skills, pay attention to how Claude actually uses them in practice. Watch for:

* **Unexpected exploration paths**: Does Claude read files in an order you didn't anticipate? This might indicate your structure isn't as intuitive as you thought
* **Missed connections**: Does Claude fail to follow references to important files? Your links might need to be more explicit or prominent
* **Overreliance on certain sections**: If Claude repeatedly reads the same file, consider whether that content should be in the main SKILL.md instead
* **Ignored content**: If Claude never accesses a bundled file, it might be unnecessary or poorly signaled in the main instructions

Iterate based on these observations rather than assumptions. The 'name' and 'description' in your Skill's metadata are particularly critical. Claude uses these when deciding whether to trigger the Skill in response to the current task. Make sure they clearly describe what the Skill does and when it should be used.

## Anti-patterns to avoid

### Avoid Windows-style paths

Always use forward slashes in file paths, even on Windows:

* ✓ **Good**: `scripts/helper.py`, `reference/guide.md`
* ✗ **Avoid**: `scripts\helper.py`, `reference\guide.md`

Unix-style paths work across all platforms, while Windows-style paths cause errors on Unix systems.

### Avoid offering too many options

Don't present multiple approaches unless necessary:

````markdown  theme={null}
**Bad example: Too many choices** (confusing):
"You can use pypdf, or pdfplumber, or PyMuPDF, or pdf2image, or..."

**Good example: Provide a default** (with escape hatch):
"Use pdfplumber for text extraction:
```python
import pdfplumber
```

For scanned PDFs requiring OCR, use pdf2image with pytesseract instead."
````

## Advanced: Skills with executable code

The sections below focus on Skills that include executable scripts. If your Skill uses only markdown instructions, skip to [Checklist for effective Skills](#checklist-for-effective-skills).

### Solve, don't punt

When writing scripts, handle error conditions explicitly rather than failing and letting Claude figure it out.

**Key principles**:
* Handle expected errors (FileNotFoundError, PermissionError) with fallbacks
* Document configuration parameters with rationale (avoid "magic numbers")
* If you don't know the right value, Claude won't either

### Provide utility scripts

Pre-made scripts offer advantages even if Claude could write them:

**Benefits**: More reliable, save tokens, save time, ensure consistency

**Important distinction**: Make clear whether Claude should execute ("Run script.py") or read as reference ("See script.py for algorithm"). Execution is preferred for reliability.

### Use visual analysis

When inputs can be rendered as images, have Claude analyze them visually:

* Convert complex documents (PDFs, forms) to images for layout analysis
* Claude's vision capabilities help understand structure and positioning
* Useful for form field detection, layout understanding, document structure

### Create verifiable intermediate outputs

Use the "plan-validate-execute" pattern for complex operations: Claude creates a plan in structured format (e.g., JSON), validates it with a script, then executes.

**Why this works**: Catches errors early, machine-verifiable, reversible planning, clear debugging.

**When to use**: Batch operations, destructive changes, complex validation rules, high-stakes operations.

### Package dependencies

List required packages in SKILL.md and verify availability in the code execution tool documentation. Note: claude.ai can install from npm/PyPI; API has no network access.

### Runtime environment

Skills run in a code execution environment with filesystem access:

* **Metadata pre-loaded**: Name and description loaded at startup
* **Files read on-demand**: SKILL.md and references accessed only when needed
* **Scripts executed efficiently**: Run without loading into context; only output consumes tokens
* **No context penalty**: Large files cost zero tokens until accessed

**Key authoring implications:**

* Use forward slashes for paths (cross-platform): `reference/guide.md`
* Name files descriptively: `form_validation_rules.md`, not `doc2.md`
* Organize directories by domain/feature for easy discovery
* Bundle comprehensive resources without context penalty
* Prefer scripts for deterministic operations over generated code
* Make execution intent clear: "Run script.py" vs "See script.py for algorithm"

### MCP tool references

If your Skill uses MCP tools, use fully qualified names: `ServerName:tool_name`

Examples: `BigQuery:bigquery_schema`, `GitHub:create_issue`

Without the server prefix, Claude may fail to locate tools when multiple MCP servers are available.

### Installation instructions

Always include explicit installation steps. Don't assume packages are pre-installed.

Example: "Install required package: `pip install pypdf`"

## Technical notes

* **YAML frontmatter**: See Skill structure section for `name` and `description` requirements
* **Token budgets**: Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines; use progressive disclosure for larger content

## Checklist for effective Skills

Before sharing a Skill, verify:

### Core quality
